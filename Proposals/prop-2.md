# Proposal 000002
### Name
##### String name expansion
### Reasoning
Rename the `str` keyword from Python into its fullname `string`. This keeps the syntax of the language more inline with other popular programming languages. 
### Syntax
Python:
```
name: str = "PyPlus"
```
PyPlus:
```
name: string = "PyPlus"
```
